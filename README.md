## 🎨 Theming and Customization

This project uses CSS variables for colors, radii, and shadows, and supports optional theme variants.

- Default theme: “Ocean”
- Optional themes: “sunset”, “forest”, “grape”

Question text visibility:

The question title uses a high-contrast color to ensure readability in both light and dark modes. To tweak it, adjust the #question-text color in style.css.

## 🔧 Where to Add Questions

Questions and quiz logic live in script.js. You can:

- Add or update the questions array
- Adjust navigation rules
- Tune review and scoring behavior
- Tip: Keep IDs in index.html (e.g., #question-text, #choice-list, #progress) as they’re used by script.js to render the UI.

## ♿ Accessibility

- Live updates: aria-live="polite" on key regions such as the quiz container and progress
- Clear focus states across interactive elements
- Color choices tuned for contrast and readability
- Motion-reduced experience via prefers-reduced-motion

## 🌐 Browser Support

- Modern evergreen browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari). The app uses progressive enhancement for newer CSS features and provides sensible fallbacks.

## ☁️ Deployment

- GitHub Pages: push the repository and enable Pages on the main branch
- Netlify/Vercel: drag-and-drop or connect your repo (no build step required)
